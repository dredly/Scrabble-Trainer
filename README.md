# Scrabble Trainer

This project will implement some of the functionality from my existing ScrabbleJS project to make a singleplayer scrabble training app.

## Current Plan
- Only 5 rounds, with a random seed to generate the letter shuffling
- Number of tiles hardcoded to 7, with ability to change this in the future

## Next Tasks

- [x] Keep track of user score
- [x] Implement bingo
- [ ] Actually show the messages on the page instead of just the console
- [ ] Refactor code into a more logical structure, i.e. with gameloop
