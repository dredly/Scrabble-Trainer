# Scrabble Trainer

This project will implement some of the functionality from my existing ScrabbleJS project to make a singleplayer scrabble training app.

## Current Plan
- Only 5 rounds, with a random seed to generate the letter shuffling
- Number of tiles hardcoded to 7, with ability to change this in the future

## Next Tasks

- [x] Change tile randomisation so that the entire bag is randomised with a seed.
- [x] Change tile replenishing so that tiles are taken out of the bag in order.
- [x] Add option to choose between a random seed and a predetermined seed.
