# Scrabble Trainer

This project will implement some of the functionality from my existing ScrabbleJS project to make a singleplayer scrabble training app.

## Current Plan
- Only 5 rounds, with a random seed to generate the letter shuffling
- Number of tiles hardcoded to 7, with ability to change this in the future

## Next Tasks

- [x] Implement a check that the user has all the letters
- [x] Check that attempted word is a real word
- [x] If it is a real word, make sure tiles are replenished properly
