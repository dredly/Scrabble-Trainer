# Scrabble Trainer

This project will implement some of the functionality from my existing ScrabbleJS project to make a singleplayer scrabble training app.

## Current Plan
- Only 5 rounds, with a random seed to generate the letter shuffling
- Number of tiles hardcoded to 7, with ability to change this in the future

## Next Tasks

- [x] Remove randomisation form upon submission and replace it with the word entry form
- [] Ensure that tilerack setup works
- [] Ensure that tilerack replenishing works
