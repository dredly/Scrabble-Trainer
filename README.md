# Scrabble Trainer

This project will implement some of the functionality from my existing ScrabbleJS project to make a singleplayer scrabble training app.

## Current Plan
- Only 5 rounds, with a random seed to generate the letter shuffling
- Number of tiles hardcoded to 7, with ability to change this in the future

## Next Tasks

- [x] Refactor code into a more logical structure
- [x] Limit the number of rounds
- [x] Add time limit
- [ ] Make word submission form auto focused
- [ ] Make timer turn red when time is low
